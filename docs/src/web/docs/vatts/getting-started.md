# Getting Started

Welcome to the Vatts.js documentation.

This section provides an overview of how Vatts works and what makes it unique.
You will learn the core ideas behind the framework before moving on to setup or code.

---

## Overview

Vatts is a full-stack framework built with a focus on speed, simplicity, and flexibility.
It allows you to build complete web applications, from frontend components to backend routes, using a single unified structure.

Vatts.js is designed around the following principles:

- A high-performance HTTP core written in Go, responsible for request handling and networking
- Instant development feedback
- Native TypeScript and JavaScript support
- Automatic routing for both frontend and backend
- Seamless and secure integration between frontend and backend, allowing client code to safely call server functions directly
- Built-in performance optimizations

Vatts scales naturally, whether you are building a small project or a large production-ready application.

## What You Should Know

Before working with Vatts, you should be familiar with:

- HTML for markup
- CSS for styling
- TypeScript and JavaScript for application logic
- React or Vue for building user interfaces

A basic understanding of React will help you quickly understand the concepts and workflow used by Vatts.js.

## About the Documentation

The examples in this documentation are written in TypeScript to demonstrate the framework's type-safe nature. However, Vatts.js fully supports JavaScript. You can adapt the code examples by simply removing the type annotations. All features are available in both languages, and you can use `.js` and `.jsx` files for your components and routes.
